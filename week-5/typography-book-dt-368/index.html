  <p> "I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen." He walked up to a black knight and put his hand to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. "Do we - er- have to join you to get across?"The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. "This wants thiking about..." he said. "I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces..."Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, "Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess -" "We're not offended," said harry quickly. "Just tell us what to do." "Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop and Hermione you go next to him instead of that castle." "What about you? "I'm going to be a knight," said Ron.The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares which Harry, Ron and Hermione took. "White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across the board. </p>
<p>"Yes...look..." A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost? "Harry - move diagonally four squares to the right." Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, face down. "Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on." Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that harry and Hermione were in danger. he himself darted around the board taking as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. "We're nearly there," he muttered suddenly. "Let me think - let me think..."
  The white queen tuened her blank face towards him. </p>
<p> "Yes..." said Ron softly, "it's the only way... I've got to be taken." "NO!" Harry and Hermione shouted. "That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me - that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!" "But -" "Do you want to stop Snape or not?" "Ron -" "Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!" There was nothing else for it. "Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. "Her I go - now, don't hand around once you've won." He stepped forward and the quite queen pounced. She struck Ron hard around the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the passageway.</p>

  <h3> Why I chose this book: </h3>
  <p> I chose this book because the first time I read it, this scene was epic. It felt like I was standing right there on the giant chessboard with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.</p>
  <h3> Why I chose these fonts: </h3>
  <p> I chose these fonts because the 'Harry Potter' series has a vintage and european feel, that is amplified by the magical mystery of the series. I feel that my header promotes that strong whimsical feel, while the body font is a clean serif to replicate the font used in the books. </p>
