## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**
The hardest part of translating my design into code was getting the margins of everything correct, and proper CSS hierarchy. 

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**
I understand the Box Model way better now, I know the names of each part and their functions. 

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**
My code matches my design pretty closely, the only thing is the dior logos aren't placed exactly where I want them on the page, as well at my caption box doesn't reach the edges of the page but both will be fixed through troubelshooting.
